Title : Lunch Box  Delivery Management System 

Introduction :

The Website is based on the Lunch Box Delivery System by the Mumbai Dabbawallas.
The objective of this project is to develop a Database Management System for an online tiffin delivery service that can efficiently manage the homecook, tiffin, dabbawala and the customer information. 
It provides a user-friendly interface for customers to book the service and for the home cooks to register on the platform. 
Additionally, the system also provides a feature for tracking your tiffin.
The front-end is created using html. 
The back-end uses Mysql. 
php is used to connect the front-end with the back-end.
